The full upstream tree at this SHA is kept locally at `upstream/openrsc-snapshot/` (gitignored — recreate via `scripts/fetch-upstream-snapshot.sh`). Use it for diffing voidscape changes against the original; never edit it.

## How divergence is tracked

Voidscape's git history starts from a single squashed vendor commit. Every voidscape change after that point is documented in this file under **Changes** below. Each entry should record:

- A short title and date.
- What was changed and why.
- Files touched (high level — full diff is in git).
- Any reversibility / upstream-sync implications.

Keep entries terse. The git log has the details.

## Changes

### 2026-04-24 — bootstrap of `server/local.conf` (voidscape preset)

Created `server/local.conf` from `preservation.conf` as voidscape's working preset. **Not tracked in git** (gitignored per upstream + voidscape rules) — bootstrap on a fresh checkout via:

```bash
cp server/preservation.conf server/local.conf
# then re-apply the overrides below
```

Voidscape overrides applied:
- `database.db_name: voidscape` — distinct DB so vanilla preservation DBs aren't shadowed
- `world.server_name: Voidscape` (and `server_name_welcome`, `welcome_text`)
- `world.want_fatigue: false` — first deliberate QoL divergence from authentic. Reason: fatigue is the most universally disliked authentic mechanic and the user's stated goal is "mostly authentic with QoL". All other progression knobs (`game_tick: 640`, `combat_exp_rate: 1`, `skilling_exp_rate: 1`, etc.) remain authentic.
- `world.is_localhost_restricted: false` — dev-only override; the upstream default unconditionally rejects auth from 127.0.0.1 (`CharacterCreateRequest.java:182`). Localhost auth is required for our local testing loop. Not a gameplay divergence.

### 2026-04-24 — F2P world (`member_world: false`)

Set `world.member_world: false` in `local.conf`. Voidscape is **F2P** by default; members content is gated off. `can_feature_membs: true` is retained so the underlying capability is intact and the flag can be flipped back without rebuilding.

Why: explicit choice during foundation testing. Aligns with the early-RSC nostalgia angle (2001-era was F2P-only) without going as far as switching to the `2001scape.conf` preset, which strips much more content.

Reversibility: flip back to `member_world: true` and restart. No data migration.

Verified: server boots in ~1.9s, listens on TCP 43596 + WS 43496, loads 836 NPCs / 1593 items / 27782 scenery / 3609 NPC spawns / 1019 ground items / 50 quests / 9 minigames / 455 plugin handlers; identifies itself as "Voidscape" in logs.

### 2026-04-24 — roofs hidden by default + toggle exposed in Game Options

Flipped three flags so the client launches with roofs hidden, and the existing (but previously gated) "Hide Roofs" menu entry appears alongside the camera-mode toggle in the Game Options panel.

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java` — `C_HIDE_ROOFS = true` (default state on every client launch); `S_SHOW_ROOF_TOGGLE = true` (so `mudclient.java:276`'s `authenticSettings` calculation falls into custom UI mode at object init, before the server's settings packet arrives, so the tabbed options panel renders correctly from boot).
- `server/local.conf` — `show_roof_toggle: true` so the server-side value matches what the client expects on login.

Why: first QoL pass. Roofs occluding indoor scenes is the universally-disliked default; original RSC and OSRS communities both gravitate to roofs-off. The OpenRSC menu wiring already existed, just gated by an `S_*` flag — voidscape ungates it.

UI placement: same Game Options tab as camera mode (manual/auto). Same list-row pattern. No new UI authored; we just exposed what was already there.

Reversibility: flip the three flags back. No data migration. Players who explicitly enabled roofs in their session keep that toggle for the session, but the next client launch defaults back to hidden.

### 2026-04-24 — XP drops enabled by default (green)

Floating "+N Skill exp" text now appears on every XP gain (and "+1 Skill level" on level-up). Same RuneLite-style overlay players expect from OSRS.

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java` — `C_EXPERIENCE_DROPS = true` (drops on by default), `C_EXPERIENCE_COUNTER_COLOR = 4` (green text), `S_EXPERIENCE_DROPS_TOGGLE = true` (server gate; the in-game color/speed/counter sub-menu rides on this same flag, so users can re-tune in the Game Options panel).
- `server/local.conf` — `experience_drops_toggle: true` so the server-side value matches.

Why: second QoL pass. RuneLite popularized on-screen XP drops; their absence is one of the most jarring "this feels old" moments when coming to RSC from OSRS.

Implementation note: feature is OpenRSC-native (overlay component built at `mudclient.java:17092`), we just ungated it. No new render code authored.

Reversibility: flip the four flags. Players can recolor or disable in-game without a config change.

### 2026-04-24 — QoL pack 1 (10 features enabled)

Batch flip of upstream-shipped features that were gated off by default. All ten map to OSRS / RuneLite ergonomics RSC players coming from OSRS expect. Same playbook as the roof / XP-drop entries: feature lives in the upstream code, we just ungate it (server config + client `S_*` static default for clean init).

Features enabled:
1. **Drop-X** — drop-N items dialog (`want_drop_x` / `S_WANT_DROP_X`).
2. **Bank presets** — saved bank loadouts (`want_bank_presets` / `S_WANT_BANK_PRESETS`).
3. **Batch skilling** — auto-repeat skilling actions with progress bar (`batch_progression` / `S_BATCH_PROGRESSION`, plus `C_BATCH_PROGRESS_BAR = true` for default-on bar).
4. **Camera zoom** — scroll-wheel zoom (`zoom_view_toggle` / `S_ZOOM_VIEW_TOGGLE`; conf was already true from preservation, sync'd the static default).
5. **Hide fog** — fog hidden by default + toggle (`fog_toggle` / `S_FOG_TOGGLE` / `C_HIDE_FOG = true`).
6. **Ground item names** — names overlay on dropped items (`ground_item_names` / `S_GROUND_ITEM_NAMES` / `C_GROUND_ITEM_NAMES = true`; conf already true).
7. **Equipment tab** — separate gear-stats interface tab (`want_equipment_tab` / `S_WANT_EQUIPMENT_TAB`).
8. **Banknotes** — item certificates without an NPC (`want_bank_notes` / `S_WANT_BANK_NOTES`).
9. **Inventory count overlay** — `X / 30` indicator (`inventory_count_toggle` / `S_INVENTORY_COUNT_TOGGLE` / `C_INV_COUNT = true`).
10. **Keyboard shortcuts level 2** — number keys select right-click menu options, with `(1)`, `(2)`… labels rendered in the menu (`want_keyboard_shortcuts: 2` / `S_WANT_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS = 2`). Bumped from upstream preservation default of 1 (where keys work but labels don't show) for discoverability.

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java` — 14 static defaults bumped.
- `server/local.conf` — 8 conf keys flipped.

**SQLite schema dependency** (gotcha discovered post-pack): enabling `want_bank_presets: true` requires the `bankpresets` table to exist in the SQLite DB. Without it, every player save fails with `no such table: bankpresets`, which silently breaks the logout flow (player save fails → `logoutSaveSuccess()` never runs → player is never removed from `world.getPlayers()` → next login attempt gets `ACCOUNT_LOGGEDIN`). Fix: apply the upstream-shipped addon migration. On a fresh checkout, run:

```bash
sqlite3 server/inc/sqlite/voidscape.db < server/database/sqlite/addons/add_bank_presets.sqlite
```

Other addon-style features that may need their migrations applied if enabled later: `add_auctionhouse.sqlite`, `add_clans.sqlite`, `add_equipment_tab.sqlite`, `add_npc_kill_counting.sqlite` — see `server/database/sqlite/addons/`.

Why: voidscape's stated direction is "smooth as butter" RSC. RuneLite normalized this set of conveniences in the OSRS world; their absence is the first thing OSRS-trained players notice when touching RSC.

Reversibility: per-feature, flip the corresponding pair back. No data migration. Existing player save data is forward-compatible (banknotes, equipment tab, presets all use add-only schemas).

Risk notes:
- **Banknotes + bank presets** are economy-affecting. Reasonable for a private server with a small player base; revisit if/when we open up multiplayer.
- **Batch skilling** changes the feel of all gathering skills. If the user reports it feeling "too AFK", we can disable per-skill or tune the batch rate (search for `S_BATCH_PROGRESSION` usage).
- **Keyboard shortcuts level 2** adds `(N)` prefixes inside right-click menu rows. Visually busier than vanilla; revert to `1` if the labels feel cluttered.

### 2026-04-24 — Right-click bank / shop direct access

Right-clicking a banker now exposes a "Bank" menu option that opens the bank UI directly, skipping the dialogue tree. Same for shopkeepers ("Trade" option).

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java` — `S_RIGHT_CLICK_BANK = true`, `S_RIGHT_CLICK_TRADE = true`.
- `server/local.conf` — matching `right_click_bank: true` / `right_click_trade: true`.

Why: NPC dialogue gating before banking/shopping is the slowest part of every banking trip in vanilla RSC. Removing it is one of the highest-leverage QoL flips available.

Implementation lives entirely in upstream plugins — `server/plugins/.../authentic/npcs/Bankers.java`, `GeneralStore.java`, `CraftingEquipmentShops.java`, `AuburysRunes.java`, plus the `Gardener.java` custom NPC. The flags just enable already-coded paths.

Reversibility: flip the four flags. No data migration.

### 2026-04-24 — Equipment tab rollback / fog hardened off / zoom speed bump

Three small follow-ups after testing QoL pack 1:

**Equipment tab disabled** — clicking the new "Equipment" sub-tab inside the inventory interface froze the client. `S_WANT_EQUIPMENT_TAB` flipped back to `false` and `want_equipment_tab: false` in `local.conf`. Reason: upstream feature appears to misbehave in our config combo (likely interacts badly with `S_WANT_BANK_PRESETS` or a session state we haven't isolated). Not worth debugging now — feature wasn't in the original priority list.

**Fog: hardened off, toggle removed** — fog is now permanently hidden with no in-game way to re-enable it.
- `mudclient.java` — the client setter `setOptionHideFog(boolean b)` now ignores the server-pushed value and forces `C_HIDE_FOG = true`. This neutralizes the per-player `setting_showfog` cache override (which was making test player "void" see fog after they'd previously toggled it).
- `mudclient.java` — the "Fog - On/Off" menu entry render block was deleted. The entry no longer appears in Game Options.
- Server-side `Player.getHideFog()` and `S_FOG_TOGGLE` are unchanged — the client just ignores them. Cleaner than mass-editing server plugins; reversible by restoring the setter and re-rendering the entry.

Why the harder approach: user wanted fog removed as a player option entirely, not just default-off. Soft-default (per QoL pack 1) loses to a stored player override; this hardcoding doesn't.

**Zoom speed** — `ORSCApplet.java:755` `zoomIncrement` bumped from `10` to `25` per scroll-wheel tick. Range is `[0, 255]` so each tick now covers ~10% (was ~4%, painfully slow per user testing). Smoothness (frame interpolation) would need new tween code; not worth it yet.

### 2026-04-24 — Fog polarity fix + zoom bump (round 2)

**Fog**: previous "harden off" change had the polarity inverted — `C_HIDE_FOG` is misleadingly named in OpenRSC. Reading `mudclient.java:5223-5240` shows that `C_HIDE_FOG = true` actually applies a *closer* fog distance (`gameWidth*2 + cameraZoom*2 - 124` ≈ 2400 at default zoom), while `C_HIDE_FOG = false` pushes fog out to `cameraZoom * 6` ≈ 4500 (effectively invisible at standard view distances). Variable name reads as "hide fog" but stored value semantically tracks "show fog" (matches the cache key `setting_showfog` used in `Player.java:3252`). Flipped:
- `Config.java:42` — `C_HIDE_FOG = false` (the value that hides fog).
- `mudclient.java setOptionHideFog` — now forces `C_HIDE_FOG = false` regardless of server input.

**Zoom (round 2)**:
- Arrow-key zoom step bumped from `± 2` to `± 8` per tick (`mudclient.java:12231-12232` and `12249-12250`), to match the *perceptual* speed of rotation (also `± 2`, but rotation is over a 360° arc and reads as much faster). Replaced the `if (< 254) += 2` pattern with `Math.min(255, x + 8)` and the symmetric `Math.max(0, x - 8)` for clean clamping at the new step size.
- Scroll-wheel `zoomIncrement` bumped from `25` to `40`.

Reversibility: per-feature, restore the changed values. No data migration.

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 1 (server pathfinder + driver + admin command)

First slice of the world-map auto-walker feature (full plan: open the world map with `M`, click anywhere, character routes there). This slice ships only the server-side pathfinder and walking driver, exposed via an admin command — no UI yet.

Files added:
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/WorldPathfinder.java` — sparse hash-keyed A* with a 50k-node frontier cap. Same-floor only for now (cross-floor via `ObjectTelePoints.xml` is slice 3). Walks the in-memory `TileValue` grid, ignoring transient mob/player blockers (those are handled at walk-time by `WalkingQueue.reset()` + our event's re-pathfind fallback). F2P regions are pruned via `Formulae.isF2PLocation` when `member_world: false`.
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/event/rsc/impl/AutoWalkEvent.java` — `GameTickEvent` that drains the precomputed path into the `WalkingQueue` in 40-tile chunks (queue capacity is 50). Self-cancels on combat / busy / displacement; a 5k-node recovery re-pathfind handles knock-back / NPC-shove cases. `DuplicationStrategy.ALLOW_MULTIPLE` because `cancelAutoWalk()` stops the prior event in-tick before the cleanup pass runs — `ONE_PER_MOB` would reject the replacement.
- `server/plugins/com/openrsc/server/plugins/authentic/commands/Pathto.java` — `::pathto x y [floor]` admin command (gated on `isAdmin()`). Reports tile count, nodes explored, and ms.

Files touched:
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/entity/player/Player.java` — `autoWalkEvent` field plus `getAutoWalkEvent` / `setAutoWalkEvent` / `cancelAutoWalk()` (idempotent; only clears the WalkingQueue if an auto-walk was active).
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/entity/Mob.java` — `setOpponent(opponent)` now calls `cancelAutoWalk()` when opponent is non-null and the mob is a player. This is the combat-cancel hook; covers both attacker and defender because both sides get `setOpponent` during the combat handshake.
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/net/rsc/handlers/WalkRequest.java` — `cancelAutoWalk()` before `resetAll/resetPath`. Covers 3D-click and minimap-click cancel, since both route through `WALK_TO_POINT`.

**Discovery correction**: docs/CODEMAP.md / earlier subsystem notes claimed `Constants.REGION_SIZE = 8`. Actual is `48` (matches RSC's sector size). Verified at `server/src/com/openrsc/server/constants/Constants.java:77`. Will be corrected when CODEMAP gets its next pass.

Tested: `::pathto 122 509` from Lumbridge spawn walked continuously to Varrock without teleport jumps; mid-walk attack on a chicken cancelled the auto-walk; mid-walk 3D click handed off cleanly to the new walk.

Reversibility: revert all six files. No data migration. No protocol change (slice 1 stays admin-command-only; opcodes land in slice 2).

### 2026-04-25 — Coords HUD overlay (always-on)

Always-visible top-left text showing `worldX, floorY (FN)` while in-game. Floor index is `worldY / 944`; the displayed Y is `worldY % 944` so upstairs / dungeons read in floor-local terms (otherwise upstairs Lumbridge prints Y ≈ 1592 instead of 648).

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java` — `C_SHOW_COORDS = true` (new flag, defaults on).
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/mudclient.java` — drawShadowText call inside the always-evaluated UI render block, immediately after the inventory-count overlay.

Reason: dev/test ergonomic for the auto-walker work — knowing exact tile coords without typing `::loc` makes verifying `::pathto x y` results trivial. Also useful for any future tile-coordinate-driven feature.

Reversibility: flip `C_SHOW_COORDS = false` (or revert the two files).

### 2026-04-24 — Disconnect = immediate unregister (no combat-log grace)

`RSCConnectionHandler:149` (the channel-close hook) now calls `player.unregister(FORCED, ...)` instead of `WAIT_UNTIL_COMBAT_ENDS`. Closing the client window now releases the player slot immediately rather than waiting up to 60 seconds for `canLogout()` to flip true.

Why: dev workflow was painful — closing the client and immediately trying to reconnect failed with "already logged in" because the combat-cooldown / busy-state checks in `canLogout()` could keep the player record in `world.getPlayers()` until the 60-second `UnregisterRequest` timeout fired.

Tradeoff: anti-combat-log protection is disabled for disconnects (a player could quit mid-fight by closing the window to escape). Acceptable for voidscape's current single-player dev posture; revisit when the server opens to multiplayer.

The explicit in-game Logout button still uses `FAIL_IN_COMBAT` (in `net/rsc/handlers/Logout.java:15`), so a player choosing to logout in combat still gets blocked.

## Re-syncing with upstream (future)

If we want to pull upstream changes:

1. Fetch latest upstream into a fresh `/tmp/openrsc-clone`.
2. Update the SHA in this file.
3. Re-run `scripts/fetch-upstream-snapshot.sh` so `upstream/openrsc-snapshot/` reflects the new SHA.
4. Manually merge / cherry-pick desired upstream changes into voidscape's working tree. We're a hard fork — there is no automated rebase.
5. Add a divergence entry recording the resync.

This is intentionally manual: we don't expect to track upstream tightly.

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 2 (WORLD_WALK_REQUEST + WORLD_WALK_ROUTE opcodes)

Wires the network round-trip for the auto-walker. Slice 1's pathfinder + walking driver now reachable from the client over the wire (still no UI; debug command `::wmw x y` types from chat).

New opcodes (append-only, never insert):
- `OpcodeIn.WORLD_WALK_REQUEST` — wire ID **35** (custom protocol). Payload: 4 bytes — `short destX; short destY` (floor encoded as `destY / 944`).
- `OpcodeOut.SEND_WORLD_WALK_ROUTE` — wire ID **100**. Payload: `byte ok; byte reason; short count; count × { short x; short y }`. Worst case ~6 KB at 1500-tile path; fits comfortably under the framing length cap.

Files added:
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/net/rsc/struct/incoming/WorldWalkStruct.java`
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/net/rsc/struct/outgoing/WorldWalkRouteStruct.java`
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/net/rsc/handlers/WorldWalkRequest.java` — runs `WorldPathfinder` and registers an `AutoWalkEvent` on success; sends the route back either way (8 reason codes including `BUSY`, `COMBAT`, `NO_PATH`, `CAP_EXHAUSTED`, `CROSS_FLOOR`, `SAME_TILE`).

Files touched:
- `OpcodeIn.java`, `OpcodeOut.java` — appended new entries (never reordered).
- `PayloadCustomParser.java` — case `35` → `WORLD_WALK_REQUEST` in switch; `isPossiblyValid` requires length 4; `parse()` reads two shorts.
- `PayloadCustomGenerator.java` — `opcodeMap` entry 100; `generate()` writes ok/reason/count + tile pairs.
- `PayloadValidator.java` — class-instance check for `WorldWalkRouteStruct`.
- `PayloadProcessorManager.java` — bind `WORLD_WALK_REQUEST` to `WorldWalkRequest.class`.
- `ActionSender.java` — `sendWorldWalkRoute(player, ok, reason, route)` helper.
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/net/Opcodes.java` — `WORLD_WALK_REQUEST(35)` appended to `Out` enum.
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/PacketHandler.java` — case `opcode == 100` → `handleWorldWalkRoute(length)` reading the wire format.
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/mudclient.java` — `worldWalkRouteOk/Reason/X/Y` fields, `sendWorldWalkRequest(x, y)` method, `setWorldWalkRoute(ok, reason, xs, ys)` receiver (chats `World-walk: N tiles.` or `World-walk failed: reason=N`), `::wmw <x> <y>` debug chat command.

Protocol contract bump:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/Config.java:CLIENT_VERSION` 10010 → **10011**.
- `server/local.conf:client_version` 10010 → **10011** (local.conf is gitignored — re-apply on a fresh checkout).

Free wire IDs picked: 35 (in) and 100 (out) were unused in the existing parser/generator maps. Future opcode adds should re-verify free IDs before claiming.

Tested: `::wmw 122 509` from Lumbridge succeeded with `World-walk: ~280 tiles.`. Failure paths verified: `::wmw 999 999` → `reason=1` (no_path), in-combat → `reason=7`, same tile → `reason=4`, cross-floor → `reason=5` (slice 3 unlocks).

Reversibility: revert all listed files and downgrade `client_version` back to 10010. The `::wmw` chat shortcut is removed in slice 5 once the world-map UI lands.

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 3 (cross-floor pathfinding via TelePointGraph)

Pathfinder now routes across floors through ladders / stairs. Two edge sources, both built lazily on first auto-walk request:

- **`ObjectTelePoints.xml`** — ~18 explicit `(point + command) → point` entries (Underground Pass, Watchtower mining camps, Lumbridge ↔ dwarven mine, etc.). Used as exact-match edges.
- **Climbable scenery (1×1 ladders)** — every `GameObject` whose `command1`/`command2` is one of `climb-up, climb up, go up, climb-down, climb down, go down` contributes an edge from each walkable adjacent tile to `(sameX, Formulae.getNewY(sameY, dir))`, mirroring `Ladders.coordModifier` for height-1 objects. This is the slice 3 v1.5 expansion — the XML alone is too sparse to reach most basements / upper floors.

Files added:
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/TelePointGraph.java` — graph builder + accessor. Logs `XML edges: N, scenery sources: M, scenery edges: K, source tiles: T` on first build for diagnostics.

Files touched:
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/WorldPathfinder.java` — accepts a `TelePointGraph`; `expand()` adds graph edges as zero-cost neighbours after the 8-cardinal sweep; cross-floor rejection only fires when `graph == null`.
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/event/rsc/impl/AutoWalkEvent.java` — detects non-adjacent next-step in the planned path; if it matches a `TelePointGraph` edge from the player's current tile, calls `Player.teleport(x, y, false)` and resumes; otherwise falls back to the existing displacement-recovery re-pathfind. `feedChunk` now stops at telepoint boundaries instead of letting `Path.addStep` interpolate through walls.
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/external/EntityHandler.java` — `getObjectTelePoints()` accessor (was previously only available via per-point lookup).
- `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/world/World.java` — `getSceneryLocs()` accessor; `getTelePointGraph()` lazy-built per-world.
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/mudclient.java` — coords HUD now displays absolute server Y (was floor-local `Y % 944`). The HUD value is what `::wmw` and `::pathto` expect, so users can paste it directly.

**Caveats:**
- Multi-tile staircases (`def.getHeight() > 1`) are skipped — destination depends on object direction in a way the static graph can't predict cleanly. Future slice 3.x.
- Quest-gated ladders are NOT excluded; the auto-walker can teleport through them even when the player would normally fail the prereq. F2P region filtering at the destination protects against accidentally landing in P2P, but quest gates within a reachable region still get bypassed. Acceptable for voidscape's single-player dev posture; revisit for multiplayer.
- F2P region filter is applied per-edge at expansion time, not at graph build — so the graph shape is the same regardless of `member_world`, only traversal differs.

Tested: walk down a Lumbridge / Edgeville ladder manually, then `::wmw <surface coord>` from the basement — auto-walks back to the ladder and climbs up. F2P → P2P gating still rejects P2P-only destinations. Reverse direction also works. Combat / 3D-click cancel still effective mid cross-floor walk.

Reversibility: revert all five files. The graph is purely runtime; no persisted state.

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 4 (rendered world map PNGs)

The slice-5 UI clicks on a world map; this slice produces it. After two false starts the working pipeline is:

- **`tools/rsc-mapgen/mapgen.jar`** — vendored from [`sean-niemann/RSC-Landscape-Generator`](https://github.com/sean-niemann/RSC-Landscape-Generator) (MIT). Pure Java, no native deps. Parses `land63.{jag,mem}` + `maps63.{jag,mem}` and emits a 2304×10944 colored PNG with all 4 floors stacked vertically.
- **`scripts/render-worldmap.sh`** — wrapper. Stages voidscape's archives into the JAR's input slot, runs the JAR, splits the output into 4 per-floor PNGs at `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/floor{0..3}.png` via ImageMagick.

Output sizes: F0=315 KB, F1=111 KB, F2=7 KB, F3=8 KB (~440 KB total).

False starts that didn't ship:
- **Server-side grayscale renderer (`::rendermap` admin command)** — initial v1 attempt rendered tiles from `TileValue.traversalMask` directly. Worked but produced a stark walkable-vs-blocked silhouette that didn't resemble the minimap (the server has no terrain-colour palette). Removed.
- **`@2003scape/rsc-landscape` (Node.js)** — installs and parses our archives correctly (`print-sector` works), but `generate-map` produces a black canvas with only POI icons. Likely a `node-canvas` regression on Node ≥ 20 (no terrain `fillRect` actually lands pixels). The same Node 25 environment runs other tools fine. Skipped after confirming the bundled-archive output is identical-broken.

Files added:
- `tools/rsc-mapgen/{mapgen.jar, LICENSE, README.md, UPSTREAM-README.md}` — vendored generator + provenance.
- `scripts/render-worldmap.sh` — wrapper.
- `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/floor{0..3}.png` — committed render output.

Files touched:
- `.gitignore` — `tools/rsc-mapgen/input/` and `tools/rsc-mapgen/map.png` (regenerated each run).
- `docs/DIVERGENCE.md` (this entry).

Files removed:
- `server/plugins/com/openrsc/server/plugins/authentic/commands/RenderWorldMap.java` — the superseded grayscale admin command. Plugin handler count returns to 456 (was 457 with this plugin).

Re-rendering: `scripts/render-worldmap.sh`. ~5 seconds. Required when the world geometry changes (rare — voidscape doesn't actively edit the landscape) or when bumping the `rsc-mapgen` vendor.

Pixel↔tile mapping (for slice 5 click handling): the per-floor image is 2304 × 2736. The world is 1008 × 944 tiles per floor — the renderer crops empty outer regions, so the image isn't a 1:1 grid. Slice 5 will calibrate empirically (click a known landmark, derive the affine transform).

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 5 (UI panel + click-to-walk)

The visible feature. RSCR2-style modal dialog, opened via a "World Map" button that appears under the minimap on hover.

Files added:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/graphics/gui/WorldMapPanel.java` — windowed dialog. Title bar with "Voidscape World Map" + "Close window" link. Floor tabs (Ground / Up 1 / Up 2 / Dungeon). Zoom +/− / Reset buttons in the right column. Map content centered on the player, scaled by current zoom (default 10×, range 1× to 24× via scroll wheel or the buttons). Yellow player marker + "You are here" label. Hand-baked landmark labels for ~13 F2P locations.

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/mudclient.java`:
  - `worldMapPanel` field; `worldWalkRouteX/Y/Reason` fields are now read by the panel for the route polyline.
  - "World Map" hover button rendered in `drawUiTabMinimap` when the cursor is over the minimap, the minimap-tab-icon area, or the button itself.
  - `drawUi` top: intercept clicks on the panel before any other handler can fire (using last frame's window rect, so side-panel handlers don't receive a click meant for the dialog).
  - `drawUi` bottom: render the panel last, so it draws on top of side panels, minimap, and chat tabs.
  - `runScroll`: routes the wheel to `worldMapPanel.adjustZoom()` when the dialog is open.

Pixel ↔ tile transform: rsc-mapgen renders sectors X=48..63 (covering world tile X 0..768) × Y=37..55 (world tile Y 0..912) at 3 px/tile, then flips the whole image on the X axis. Map math:
- `pngX = 2303 − worldX × 3`
- `pngY = (worldY % 944) × 3`

World tiles X=768..1008 and Y=912..944 are not rendered — those regions fall outside the PNG. Voidscape's F2P content all lives within the rendered range, so this is fine in practice.

Click flow: `mudclient.handleClick` → world tile via the inverse transform → `sendWorldWalkRequest(x, y)` → server's `WorldWalkRequest` runs the pathfinder + drives `AutoWalkEvent` (slice 1) → `SEND_WORLD_WALK_ROUTE` (slice 2) → panel renders the polyline in green dots.

Discovery notes:
- The Ctrl+M hotkey was tried first but doesn't work on macOS — `controlPressed` doesn't track the macOS Command/Control through this client's input stack reliably. The hover-button is the canonical opener.
- The grayscale "::rendermap" command from slice 4's first attempt has been retired in favour of the `rsc-mapgen`-based PNG.

Caveats / known gaps versus RSCRevolution2's reference:
- No POI icons (altars, cooking guilds, etc.) on the map.
- Hand-baked landmark list is ~13 names; RSCR2 ships dozens with smart placement.
- No search box, no favourites bar.
- These are deferred to slice 6 (polyline polish) and beyond.

Reversibility: revert the two files. The committed `Cache/worldmap/floor*.png` PNGs from slice 4 stay either way.

### 2026-04-25 — World-map auto-walker, slice 5b (vendored rsc-world-map assets + UX polish)

Replaces slice 5's hand-baked rendering with a port of `2003scape/rsc-world-map@70f488a` (AGPLv3). The plane PNGs are the same upstream renderer's output (2448×2736, 3 px/tile, X-mirrored — different transform from slice 4's `rsc-mapgen` output) and we vendor 110 place-name labels, 309 POI markers, and 42 sprite icons alongside. Refresh procedure documented in `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/UPSTREAM.md`.

Files added:
- `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/UPSTREAM.md` — vendor SHA + refresh procedure.
- `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/plane-{0..3}.png` — replaces slice 4's `floor{0..3}.png` (the slice-4 PNGs are removed; the `rsc-mapgen` pipeline is no longer used for client rendering).
- `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/labels.tsv`, `points.tsv`, `icons/*.png`, `stone-background.png` — overlay data.

Files touched:
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/graphics/gui/WorldMapPanel.java` — major rework: 4 discrete zoom levels (0.5×, 1×, 2×, 4×) replacing slice 5's 1×–24× continuous zoom; drag-pan with 3 px deadzone; stone-textured zoom buttons matching upstream; cursor-focused wheel zoom; **75% × 75% windowed dialog** (was fullscreen); **default zoom level 2 (4×)** so the player marker lands in a ~58 × 43 tile view comparable to the in-game minimap radius; floor-switch re-centers the map. New `pollMouse(mx, my, buttonDown, gameWidth, outWorld)` API replaces single-shot `handleClick`; the panel manages drag transitions internally and walk only fires on a non-drag release.
- `Client_Base/src/orsc/mudclient.java`:
  - `drawUi` top: switched to the new `pollMouse` API, called every frame so drag state advances even when the cursor leaves the content rect.
  - `drawUi` bottom: render unchanged (still last, on top).
  - `drawUiTabMinimap`: World Map button is now persistent whenever the minimap tab is the active side panel (`showUiTab == Config.MINIMAP_AND_COMPASS_TAB`), in addition to the existing hover behavior.
  - `runScroll`: plumbs `mouseX/Y` through to `adjustZoom(delta, focusX, focusY)` so the wheel zoom centers on the cursor.
  - `setWorldWalkRoute`: numeric `reason=N` chat dump replaced by per-code messages (e.g. `1 → "Can't find a path there."`).
- `PC_Client/src/orsc/ORSCApplet.java` — `mouseDragged` returns early if the world-map panel is visible, so camera rotation doesn't fight the drag-pan underneath.

Pixel ↔ tile transform (matches `Client_Base/Cache/worldmap/UPSTREAM.md`):
- `pngX = 2471 − worldX × 3`
- `pngY = (worldY % 944) × 3`

(Different origin from slice 4's `rsc-mapgen` transform; this one is empirically calibrated against 7 city labels, ±10 px.)

Server-side change — `server/src/com/openrsc/server/model/WorldPathfinder.java`:
- Added `nearestWalkable(end, radius)` ring search and a snap step in `findPath`. When a click lands on a wall, building roof, coastline, or (on F2P worlds) a P2P-restricted region, the pathfinder snaps to the nearest walkable tile within radius=5 (Chebyshev — matches the in-game minimap radius). Maintains floor and F2P invariants. Without this, "click anywhere on the world map" was silently failing on every imprecise click; this is the difference between an annoying feature and a useful one.

POIs and labels render only on plane 0 — upstream's `labels.json` / `points.json` are floor-0-only. Floors 1–3 show the geometry without overlay text; this matches upstream behavior.

Reversibility: revert the listed files and restore `floor{0..3}.png` from git. Server change is additive (new method + snap branch) and reverts cleanly. No protocol or opcode changes — `CLIENT_VERSION` stays at 10010.

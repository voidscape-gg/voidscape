# Divergence from upstream OpenRSC

Voidscape is a hard fork of [Open-RSC/Core-Framework](https://github.com/Open-RSC/Core-Framework).

## Vendor reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Upstream repo | `Open-RSC/Core-Framework` |
| Vendored SHA | `fc74d38e2ead0a5864b48ae191b7184a391777cf` |
| Vendored date | 2026-04-24 |
| License | AGPLv3 (inherited — see `LICENSE`) |
| Branch vendored from | default branch at the time of clone |

The full upstream tree at this SHA is kept locally at `upstream/openrsc-snapshot/` (gitignored — recreate via `scripts/fetch-upstream-snapshot.sh`). Use it for diffing voidscape changes against the original; never edit it.

## How divergence is tracked

Voidscape's git history starts from a single squashed vendor commit. Every voidscape change after that point is documented in this file under **Changes** below. Each entry should record:

- A short title and date.
- What was changed and why.
- Files touched (high level — full diff is in git).
- Any reversibility / upstream-sync implications.

Keep entries terse. The git log has the details.

## Changes

### 2026-04-24 — bootstrap of `server/local.conf` (voidscape preset)

Created `server/local.conf` from `preservation.conf` as voidscape's working preset. **Not tracked in git** (gitignored per upstream + voidscape rules) — bootstrap on a fresh checkout via:

```bash
cp server/preservation.conf server/local.conf
# then re-apply the overrides below
```

Voidscape overrides applied:
- `database.db_name: voidscape` — distinct DB so vanilla preservation DBs aren't shadowed
- `world.server_name: Voidscape` (and `server_name_welcome`, `welcome_text`)
- `world.want_fatigue: false` — first deliberate QoL divergence from authentic. Reason: fatigue is the most universally disliked authentic mechanic and the user's stated goal is "mostly authentic with QoL". All other progression knobs (`game_tick: 640`, `combat_exp_rate: 1`, `skilling_exp_rate: 1`, etc.) remain authentic.

Verified: server boots in ~1.9s, listens on TCP 43596 + WS 43496, loads 836 NPCs / 1593 items / 27782 scenery / 3609 NPC spawns / 1019 ground items / 50 quests / 9 minigames / 455 plugin handlers; identifies itself as "Voidscape" in logs.

## Re-syncing with upstream (future)

If we want to pull upstream changes:

1. Fetch latest upstream into a fresh `/tmp/openrsc-clone`.
2. Update the SHA in this file.
3. Re-run `scripts/fetch-upstream-snapshot.sh` so `upstream/openrsc-snapshot/` reflects the new SHA.
4. Manually merge / cherry-pick desired upstream changes into voidscape's working tree. We're a hard fork — there is no automated rebase.
5. Add a divergence entry recording the resync.

This is intentionally manual: we don't expect to track upstream tightly.
